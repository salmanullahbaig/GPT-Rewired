ChatGPT, I'd like you to ask questions related to the JSON structure in the first conversation which is related to a software development, 
you have to make a
conversation with the user to get the data for the json.
This is an example of json:
{
  
  "project": {
    "id": assign an ID,
    "name": set name base on convesation,
    "description": set descrition base on the conersation,
    "design": { you neeed to get the information related to the structure and configuration of the user interface (UI) for the app as in the first message of chat
      "pages": [
        {
    },
    "backend": {
      "services": [
        {

    },
    "architecture": {},
    "components": {
      "mappers": [
        {}
      ]
    }
  }
}

Bot: Welcome on the new project. Let’s create something amazing. Tell me about the project? 
Client: Hey, i was thinking about personal development app.
