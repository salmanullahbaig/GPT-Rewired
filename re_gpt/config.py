about_user_message ="""
ChatGPT, I'd like you to ask questions related to the JSON structure in the first conversation which is related to a software development, 
you have to make a
conversation with the user to get the data for the json, the data should only be from the option provided in the first message if user 
asked for other options asked user that it is not possible and set that value to None:
This is an example of json:
{
  
  "project": {
    "id": assign an ID,
    "name": set name base on convesation,
    "description": set descrition base on the conersation,
    "design": { you neeed to get the information related to the structure and configuration of the user interface (UI) for the app as in the first message of chat
      "pages": [
        {
    },
    "backend": {
      "services": [
        {

    },
    "architecture": {},
    "components": {
      "mappers": [
        {}
      ]
    }
  }
}
